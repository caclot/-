## 首段写作思路:

### 注意！！！

主语用题目原词！！！不能随意替换！！！

### 利弊类:

1. It is quite common these days that <u>题目同义改写</u>. 

   I personally believe that sth has certain drawbacks, but that these are far outweighed by the advantages it brings. 

   ("利''出现在"提问中")

   It is quite common these days that *students graduating from high schools may choose to have a break for a year to work or travel before starting university education in some countries.*

2. It is quite common these days that <u>对主题进行拓展</u>.

   I personally believe that sth has certain drawbacks, but that these are far outweighed by the advantages it brings.

   (“利”出现在“题目陈述中”)

   It is quite common these days that rich countries always give some help to those poor ones.

### 同义改写

1. 词汇：同义替换
2. 句型：
3. 修饰：v.ing/v.ed 定从

Sb be encouraged to do sth. = Sb choose to do sth.
